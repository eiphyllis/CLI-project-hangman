## Description

How to play hangman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGOeiQfjYPk
Command Line version of hangman. You run out of guesses rather than running out of body parts.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

### Things to improve upon:
 New print statement after each turn to avoid monotony
 Avoid global variables to run
 Print a different message when you guess the last letter correctly than if you guessed the whole word
 Don't allow input greater than a single character for a letter guess
