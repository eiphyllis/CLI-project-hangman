Command Line version of hangman: A player is given a random word at the start of the game and 10 chances to guess the correct letters. The player also has the option to guess the correct word. A player is given 10 points for every word they guess correctly. A player can check out the scoreboard to see tops scores and My games to see how many games they have won and lost.

## Roadmap

### Things to improve upon:
 - New print statement after each turn to avoid monotony
 - Avoid global variables to run
 - Print a different message when you guess the last letter correctly than if you guessed the whole word
 - Don't allow input greater than a single character for a letter guess
